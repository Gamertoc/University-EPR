Repository for my solutions for the EPR homework tasks. 

I actually wrote this code, therefore it belongs to me and only me (except there is another author in the __author__ variable). The code isn't necessarily working or complete, but since this are the ones I send in I'll do my very best. Feel free to look for ideas on how to solve the problems. However, I do not advice you to simply copy and paste my files, since 1) I do not allow it, 2) they have tools to find out if solutions were copied and if I get a complaint about that I will surely take this repo down, and 3) it won't help you in your exam.
So please be fair to everyone and enjoy.

I worked with two other people, one on Task04 and Task05 and the other on Task07. Just a little note on that:
Task04 and Task05: Collab worked smoothly, thank you very much.
Task07: Imo horror. Didn't work out at all. The deadline was tight (1 week instead of 2 due to vacation), but I still managed to finish my part with some time to spare to make adjustments on the other hand. My collab tho didn't start until I finished (at which point the deadline was about 2 days away) and - how else - couldn't make it. 
The documentation on that is 90% from me as well. 

Well, can't go smoothly everytime.
