description_help = """Description of "help":

With help() you can get help to literally everything: modules, functions, classes, methods, 
keywords and documentation topics - it will print a help page for you! """
description_len = """Description of "len":

Gives you the length (the number of items) of the given object.
"""
description_import = """Description of "import":

As its name says, import lets you import anything from modules to classes and their functions so 
you can use them in your code. """
description_id = """Description of "id":

With this awesome but quite useless tool you can get the ID of any object. The ID is essentially 
a unique identifier, its memory address. """
description_in = """Description of "in":

This little guy works like the "exists" operator in LinADi. It simply checks whether the given 
object is there or not. It can be used to iterate through a sequence, since it just goes through 
every object. """
description_chr = """Description of "chr":

chr(i) gives you that character (in a string) which has i as its Unicode value.
"""
description_max = """Description of "max":

max() will give you the largest item of whatever you decide to put between those brackets. Be it 
a list, an array or just numbers. And if there are multiple highest values, it will just return 
the first one it encounters. """
description_bin = """Description of "bin":

Converts any given integer into its binary equal with the prefix "0b".
"""
description_is = """Description of "is":

Is is a pretty useful (or maybe useless) keyword. It checks whether two variables refer to the 
same object, which essentially means that they are the same object. However, it will return 
False when they are different objects, even if they are 100% equal. """
description_del = """Description of "del":

With del you can delete any object, whether it is a variable or an object of another class. It 
just goes poof! and it's gone. """
